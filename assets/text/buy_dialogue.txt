We're taking the nets off our factory windows!
I'm sure the CEO is proud of us :)
Razing that rainforest was a great investment!
They say it couldn't be done
Labor laws? More like labor suggestions!
There were those who said it could not be done!
All delivered, and ahead of shedule!
The bonuses this year are going to be huge!
A new photocopier? Christmas came early this year!
Another senator on our dime!
Overpromise, overdeliver!
We successfully overthrew that foreign government!
The CEO will be able to buy another boat!
You didn't hear this from me, but invest in us NOW
Just got that big new contract signed!
The whole government is in our pocket!
