At least only three of the factories burned down
When this the press gets on this, we're screwed
My mother will be so ashamed of us
Sales haven't gone down, we're still at a steady 0
We're going to have to fire so many people
I'll have to sell my kid's bike
I'm never going to be able to retire
So all of the heads of all of the departments quit?
Once this goes out, we're toast
We won't be able to cover that stuff up much longer
Say goodbye to your kids' college fund everybody!
Things are looking really grim
At this rate, the company will be lethal!
They say he's like the new Elon Musk
We told them it's not ready yet...
My face is gonna be beet red for my family photos!
The music dance experience is officially cancelled
All I can be is sorry, and that is all I am
My boss is going to kill me
They found out about the embezzling...
Look at our lawyer dawg, we're going to jail...
I'm shaking and crying
The guy we lobbied for lost the election...
