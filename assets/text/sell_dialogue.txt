At least only three of the factories burned down
When this the press gets on this, we're screwed
My mother will be so ashamed of us
Well sales haven't gone down, we're still at a steady 0
We're going to have to fire so many people
I'll have to sell my kid's bike
I'm never going to be able to retire
So all of the heads of all of the departments quit?
Once this goes out, we're toast
We won't be able to cover all that stuff up much longer
Sat goodbye to your children's college fund everybody!
Things are looking really grim
